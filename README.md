# Analog-Communication-Techniques

I focused on exploring and implementing various modulation schemes and systems that are fundamental to analog communication. These involved the use of MATLAB and Simulink for simulation and analysis of analog communication systems.

Amplitude Modulation (AM) System Design and Analysis:
I designed and analyzed an AM system, implemented the modulation and demodulation blocks to transmit and recover analog signals, explored the effects of varying modulation index and carrier frequency on the transmitted signal and evaluated the system's performance in terms of power efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). 

Frequency Modulation (FM) System Simulation and Analysis:
I simulated and analyzed FM systems, implemented the FM modulation and demodulation blocks to transmit and recover analog signals, examined the impact of modulation index and carrier frequency deviation on the transmitted signal's bandwidth and evaluated the system's performance in terms of noise immunity and frequency stability.

Single-Sideband (SSB) Modulation System Design:
I designed and implemented a Single-Sideband (SSB) modulation system, focused on generating the upper or lower sideband of the modulated signal while suppressing the other sideband and the carrier, explored techniques such as filtering and phase shifting to achieve SSB modulation and demodulation.

Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) System Implementation:
I implemented a Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) system,generated pulse signals with varying amplitudes to represent discrete analog values and performed modulation and demodulation processes, evaluated the system's performance in terms of symbol error rate, noise tolerance, and spectral efficiency.

Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) System Simulation:
I simulated and analyzed Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) systems, implemented QAM modulation and demodulation schemes, exploring different constellations and levels of modulation. I examined the system's performance in terms of symbol error rate, data rate, and bandwidth efficiency.

These assignments on analog communication techniques equipped me with a solid foundation in understanding modulation schemes, such as AM, FM, SSB, PAM, and QAM. They enabled me to gain practical experience in system design, simulation, and analysis using MATLAB and Simulink. The projects also enhanced my understanding of system performance evaluation, noise effects, and bandwidth utilization in analog communication.
